# Numbers Round!

This is an implementation of the numbers game from the popular television show Countdown.

Here is how the game works: 
  * There are 6 numbers to make a three digit target number.
  * A target can be made from using the four basic aritmetic operations.
  * Numbers don't have to be used, but they may only be used once.
  * Large numbers are chosen at random from the set {25, 50, 75, 100} and the user can choose between 0 and 4 unique numbers.
  * Small numbers are chosen at random from the numbers from 1-10, each of which can be chosen twice.
  * Fractions or negative numbers may not be used at any intermediate step
  * Try to get as close to the target as possible.
